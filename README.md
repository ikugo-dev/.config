## Guide

The `.setup` file is meant for a quick start on a fresh Arch install.

I can not and will not guarantee that the setup will work for everyone,

as it is not meant for everyone.

It installs a lot more programs than I have listed in the programs section,

and I keep updating it to match my current daily driver.


**If you want to copy my setup**, I would suggest that you

**just copy the contents of the .config folder** for all the programs that you need.
